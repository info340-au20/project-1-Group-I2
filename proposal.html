        <h2><em>Problem Description</em></h2>
        <section>
            <h4>Problem Overview</h4>
            <p>
                “Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, 
                and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. 
                Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer.” (2018) 
                Though everybody knows cancer can be really severe, 
                not many people know it might just be around us, 
                especially those who are under 40. 
                This summer was quite difficult for me since my grandfather,  
                who is the forth one in my family, was diagnosed with cancer. 
                All these cases in my family keep ringing the 
                bell for me to be aware of cancer. 
            </p>

            <h4>Identify the information technology & existing attempts</h4>
            <p>
                Tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity 
                can be major cancer risk factors worldwide (2018), 
                and these behaviors are really common in the university. 
                As a result, we think this project can be a good opportunity 
                for us to let more young people pay attention to cancer.  
                Though WHO already has the website for cancer, 
                it focuses globally and all age groups. 
                Also, causes, risks and the description for each kind of 
                cancer are in different pages. 
                The cancer website of WHO might be a panacea since 
                there is enough information from all aspects. 
                However, to make more young people be aware of cancer, 
                a website which contains more information in less pages 
                is probably needed. Also, early detection should be emphasized 
                in our website due to the precaution function. 
                Moreover, we’d want to have less terminology and more clear 
                user direction to better lead the young as our users.

        <h2><em>Proposed Application</em></h2>
        <section>
            <h4>Target User</h4>
            <p>
                The target users of this website are people who don’t know much about 
                risk factors and types of cancer, especially for young people. Users 
                will be viewing information about the incidence of cancers by cancer 
                site, age, state, sex, and risk factor. We use dataset from
                <cite><a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html">USCS Data Visualizations</a></cite>.

            <h4>Interaction</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users will first see four rectangles showing the top risk factors of cancers, 
                    including alcohol, tobacco, obesity, and physical inactivity. Users can select 
                    one of the factors by clicking the corresponding rectangle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the page of a specific risk factor, users can fill in their age in the input box, select sex, 
                        and state to see the incidence of factor-associated cancers of different cancer 
                        sites for the corresponding age range and state in the form of bar charts. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
                By viewing the incidence of all kinds of cancers that have happened in a specific state, 
                users will realize cancer is very common in their lives. Risk factors such as smoking, drinking, 
                unhealthy diet, obesity that young people usually don’t pay much attention to may 
                lead to cancers for lacking appropriate prevention. We hope users will raise the awareness of cancer 
                prevalence and keep a healthy lifestyle for prevention through our website.
