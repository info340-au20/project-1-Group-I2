        <h2><em>Problem Description</em></h2>
        <!-- subsection -->
        <section>
            <h4>Problem Overview</h4>
            <p>
                “Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, 
                and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. 
                Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer.” (2018) 
                Though everybody knows cancer can be really severe, 
                not many people know it might just around us, 
                especially those who are under 40. 
                This summer was quite difficult for me since my grandfather,  
                who is the forth one in my family, was diagnosed with cancer. 
                All these cases happened in my family keep ringing the 
                bell for me to be aware of cancer.

            <h4>Identify the information technology & existing attempts</h4>
            <p>
                Tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity 
                can be major cancer risk factors worldwide (2018), 
                and these behaviors are really common in the university. 
                As a result, we think this project can be a good opportunity 
                for us to let more young people paying attention on cancer.  
                Though WHO already has the website for cancer, 
                it focuses globally and all age groups. 
                Also, causes, risks and the description for each kind of 
                cancer are in different pages. 
                The cancer website of WHO might be a panacea since 
                there are enough information from all aspects. 
                However, to make more young people be aware of cancer, 
                a website which contains more information in less pages 
                is probably needed. Also, early detection should be emphasized 
                in our website due to the precaution function. 
                Moreover, we’d want to have less terminology and more clear 
                user direction to better lead the young as our users.
